I recently completed a Power BI dashboard focused on HR Analytics, aimed at transforming raw HR data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making. This interactive report empowers HR leaders to track and analyze key metrics including:

✅ Attrition KPI ( avg salary, avg age and others)
✅ Attrition and retention trends
✅ Department-wise Attrition details
✅ Attrition by educationfield,Job role and Years
✅ Average Attrition Age and salary 

The dashboard was designed with usability in mind—featuring dynamic filters, drill-down capabilities, and clean visual storytelling to support data-driven HR decisions.

Tools used: Power BI | DAX | Power Query | Excel

This project helped me deepen my understanding of HR metrics and improve my data visualization and report-building skills
